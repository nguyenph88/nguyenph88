This file is call README and you are actually READING ME now.
I don't have a fancy README file. The more I write it just make you feel like I used AI. Well in fact that's what people are doing right now in the real world.

In short:
- I'm lazy so I make things to work for me (bots, automation tools, scrapers etc.)
- I work my main job during day time (and sometimes late).
- I host my game servers and mod it the way I want during night time.
- You won't find me at home during weekend, I will be out exploring and spending times with my family.

Come find my in my discord :)
